# This file is used to define Tables of Contents (ToCs).
# It is a YAML file, where the top-level structure is an array.
#
# Each entry in the top-level array (that is, each ToC entry) has three keys:
#
# NOTE: All keys are required!
#
# * "id" is a simple string.  When you use {% include toc.html id="..." %}
#   to bring the ToC into your page, this is what identifies which ToC you want
#   to bring in.
#
# * "header" is a text string, which is used as the header of your ToC.
#   NOTE: You are responsible for capitalization (small-caps/auto-caps is not
#   used).
#
# * "items" is an array of ToC items.
#
#   Each item in the "items" array has two keys:
#
#   NOTE: All keys are required!
#
#   * "name" is the name of the ToC entry.
#
#   * "target" is the destination path, relative to the site root.
#     NOTE: If an empty string is used, it will be replaced with "index.html".
#
#   The order of your "items" array is used to determine the order in which
#   items will appear in the ToC.  The current page will automatically be
#   hilighted.
